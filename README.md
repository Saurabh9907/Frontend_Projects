# Frontend_Projects
This repository contains frontend projects created as part of my learning journey in frontend web development. I started with basic HTML and CSS projects and gradually moved to JavaScript and React. Each project is placed in a separate folder and focuses on responsive design, UI/UX basics, JavaScript logic, reflecting my learning and growthskills.
